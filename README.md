**Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so I am. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.
